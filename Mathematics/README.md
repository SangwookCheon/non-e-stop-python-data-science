# Mathematics for Data Science - Overview
## Introduction 
I decided to review or learn Mathematics concepts relevant to Machine Learning, including Calculus, Precalculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc.   

Using real papers to take notes has its own charm, but I found using Markdown to take notes very useful. Markdown supports LaTeX, a mathematics notation tool I can use to make any kind of mathematical expression. Also, using Markdown allows me to avoid having to deal with too many functions in Google Docs or Word, instead I can focus on getting the content down with minimal use of styling. Of course, when solving actual problems, I would definitely prefer using papers and pencils :smile:

## Learning Resources
There are two main resources I am currently using to study mathematics: OpenStax free textbooks, and MIT Opencourseware courses on Mathematics. 
* [OpenStax] textbooks are great to get the foundation, as they are so comprehensive in explanation of concepts, as can be partially seen from their gigantic volume. OpenStax provides free online textbooks for almost all domains of mathematics included in the normal school curriculum. They are free, and yet the quality is priceless. These textbooks are actually being used all around the world.
* [MITopencourseware] provides courses from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the level of content is often beyond what can be expected in high school. This is probably the only learning platform that openly distributes university-level courses on university-level subjects, and it has a massive collection of courses focused on Mathematics (among many other subjects). It has courses on Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Statistics, and so on. Check it out!

[Update]: Now I am in the process of reviewing Precalculus, so I will upload what I learned as soon as possible.
