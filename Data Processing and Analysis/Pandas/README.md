# Pandas 
Pandas is one of the core Python libraries for data processing. This folder is intended to increase the understanding of Pandas and its applications. 

I suggest you look at the notebooks in the following order, because the difficulty increases as the list goes down. 

## IBM Data Science Course
[Link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate)
This course provides great resources for Pandas beginners, and really covers a lot on initial Data Processing/Cleaning and Data Analysis. If you follow the steps specified in the notebooks, then you will be able to work with csv files very effectively and not miss a thing. The last two notebooks also dive into relatively simple creation of models, such as linear regression.

* **2. Preprocessing Data in Python.ipynb**
* **3. Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**
* **4. Model Development.ipynb**

## A-Z Data Science

The Course did not dive deeply into Pandas, so there is a need to learn more through other sources. This notebook rather focuses primarily on Scikit-learn.
