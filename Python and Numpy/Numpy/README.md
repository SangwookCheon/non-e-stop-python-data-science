## Numpy - Overview
Numpy is a very important library in Python used for advanced mathematical operations, of which many are particularly relevant for machine learning, such as dot product, matrix multiplication, tranposing, etc. Numpy is a library with so many things to learn, so I will add here anything I learn about Numpy.

* **Python+Basics+With+Numpy+v3.ipynb** - I learned a lot from this, but I think this notebook does not touch a wide range of Numpy operations. Also, this notebook focuses largely on building useful libraries for machine learning based on Numpy.
