# Study of Python
I chose python as the foundational language for machine learning, so I created this folder to review my knowledge and add more skills in Python along the way. I do have experience working with Python, but there are many advanced concepts and operations that I have not looked into yet. So, 

I added two subfolders for this: Python Basics and Python Advanced. Any materials that count as review for me will go to the Python Basics folder. Anything else will be put into Python Advanced. Python basics will include materials up to Classes and IO.
