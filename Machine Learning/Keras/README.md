# Overview  
This folder is dedicated to learning about Keras, a machine-learning library. I documented where I got the learning resources from. 

**Keras** is one of the best tools I use for machine learning. It allows me to create models very quickly and intuitively.

[Linke to the course](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)
- **artificial-neural-networks-ann-keras.ipynb** - 
- **convolutional-neural-networks-cnn-keras.ipynb** -  

Note: The material covered in this course regarding Keras is quite shallow. The course mainly focuses on scikit-learn, so it only scratches the surface of what Keras can do. So, I need to learn from more detailed resources specifically on Keras.
