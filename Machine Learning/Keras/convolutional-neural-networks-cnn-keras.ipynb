I added some useful notes along the way to clarify things. This notebook's content is from A-Z Datascience course, and I hope this will be useful to those who want to review materials covered, or anyone who wants to learn the basics of CNN.\n\n## Content:\n### Explanation\n### 1.

Stride is the number of pixels with which we slide the detector. If it is one, we are moving it one pixel each time and recording the value (adding up all the multiplied values). Many feature detectors are used, and the algorithm finds out what is the optimal way to filter images. 3 x 3 feature detector is commonly used, but other sizes can be used.\n\n# ReLU\nAfter feature detectors are applied upon images, ReLU is used to increase non-linearity within images. \n\n# Max Pooling\nTake a 2 x 2 box on the top left corner (starting here), and record the maximum number within the box. Slide it to the right with the stride of 2 (commonly used), and move onto the next row if completed. Repaet this step until all the pixels are evaluated. Aim of max pooling is to keep all the important features even if images have spatial or textual distortions, and also reduce the size which prevents overfitting. So, after applying convolution operation to images, than pooling is applied.\n\nOther pooling techniques are also available such as Mean Pooling, which takes the average of pixels within the box.\n\n# Flattening\nFlatten the matrix into a long vector which will be the input to the artificial neural network\n\n# Full Connection\nImplement full Artificial Neural Network model to optimize weights.\n\n# Softmax & Cross entropy\nSoftmax function brings all predicted values to be between 0 and 1, and make them add up to 1. It also comes hand-in-hand with cross-entropy method. \n\nJust seeing how many wrong predictions the classifier made is not enough to evaluate the performance of ANNs. Instead, Cross Entropy should be used to measure how good the model is, as there can be two models that produce same results while one produced better percentages than the other. For classificaion, Cross Entropy should be used, and for regression, Mean Squared Error should be used. \n\n---------\n\nWe will create a simple dog vs cat classifier. To be able to work with keras library, we need proper structure of images. There should be two folders: Test set and Train set. And, in each folder, cat images and dog images should be placed in two separate folders. In this way, keras will understand how to work with them.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dd72cab91e1527fc88e2aa80bf23c706e6d351a4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
