# Machine Learning Learning Resources  
I documented all the resources that I used to learn machine learning. Being able to create machine learning models require quite an extensive range of skills, including:
* Processing various forms of data, such as csv files, text, images, and audio. This requires the use of various libraries such as Pandas, OpenCV, and more (I am sure I will learn more libraries along the way :))
* Being able to locate useful data for machine learning projects, such as web scraping.
* Proficiency in Python and Numpy, the most basic tools for building models
* Being able to manage large datasets, along with proper skills in hardware.
* Having an understanding of various machine learning models.
* Proficiency in machine learning libraries such as Keras and scikit-learn
* Data Visualization and Analysis skills
* Mathematical skills, especially linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.
* Patience and Passion


Learning "Machine Learning," is surely a long journey, and this is why I want to document all the things I learn day by day, hoping that my scope of knowledge icnreases as this folder grows in volume. 

Based on the essential skills that I identified above, I added subfolders corresponding to each skillset I need for machine learning:
* **Improving NN**
* **Keras**
* **NN and DL from scratch**
* **Scikit-learn techniques**

I will add more categories if needed, as there is no end to the Machine Learning journey.
