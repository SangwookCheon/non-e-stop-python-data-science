# Overview  
Yes, being able to implement machine learning models is very important. However, it is also crucial to take time understanding the models deeply, and gain the ability to create models from scratch just using basic libraries including Numpy. 

To be able to do this, I took excellent courses that dive deep into the foundations of machine learning.

Course: Neural Networks and Deep Learning  

This course was exceptional, as it allowed me to understand all the theory behind machine learning, and mathematical operations that make it possible. As the course described, machine learning is still a complex combination of mathematical expressions. I gained a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning and deep learning actually works. I really liked this bottom-up approach, not just trying to jump right into applications of machine learning.   
- **Building+your+Deep+Neural+Network+-+Step+by+Step+v8.ipynb** - Step-by-step guide to building neural networks from scratch, only using Numpy and other fundamental python libraries. 
- **Deep+Neural+Network+-+Application+v8.ipynb**
- **Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset+v5.ipynb** - A notebook to look at before diving into deep neural networks. Dives into the mathematical operations for logistic regression, which is simpler than a standard neural network.
- **Planar+data+classification+with+one+hidden+layer+v5.ipynb** 
- **Python+Basics+With+Numpy+v3.ipynb** - Review of Python and Numpy. Please note that there is a more comprehensive review of Python, starting from the basics, in another folder: Python and Numpy/Python Basics

Note: These notebooks are created by the course provider, and I walked through the assignments. So, they are not entirely created by me.
