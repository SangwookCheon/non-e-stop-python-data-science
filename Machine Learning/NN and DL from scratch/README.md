# Overview  
Yes, being able to implement machine learning models is very important. However, it is also crucial to take time understanding the models deeply, and gain the ability to create models from scratch just using basic libraries including Numpy. 

To be able to do this, I took excellent courses that dive deep into the foundations of machine learning.

Course: Neural Networks and Deep Learning  

This course was exceptional, as it allowed me to understand all the theory behind machine learning, and mathematical operations that make it possible. As the course described, machine learning is still a complex combination of mathematical expressions. I gained a comprehensive understanding of how machine learning and deep learning actually works. I really liked this bottom-up approach, not just trying to jump right into applications of machine learning.
