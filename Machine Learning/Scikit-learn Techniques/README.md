# Overview  
This folder is dedicated to gaining skills in Scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is great in two ways: It is an easy-to-use and powerful machine learning library on its own, and it can work hand-in-hand seamlessly with other libraries like Keras. Knowing scikit-learn allows me to compensate what cannot be done in other libraries.

## A-Z Data Science on Udemy

This course's main focus on scikit-learn, so I was able to learn greatly from it. It contains a large volume of scikit-learn techniques, which I documented below. These notebooks are entirely created by me to practice what I learned, and document core concepts.
