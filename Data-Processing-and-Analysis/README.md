# Data Processing and Analysis
Data Processing and Analysis is the first step in any data science project, including machine learning. I need to have skills to explore and manipulate data to make it useful for my project. This folder is entirely for learning about Data Processing and Analysis skills in Python. 

This folder currently lacks content, but I will update this very soon. I will learn in more depth about Pandas and other data processing libraries. 

* **Pandas** - This is an essential library for data science. It can be used to read csv files, excel files, and can handle many more file types. It is also useful for versatile data manipulation. 

I will add more sections soon, each corresponding to one python library.
