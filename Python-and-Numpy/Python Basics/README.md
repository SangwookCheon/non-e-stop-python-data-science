# Python Basics
This folder is to review the programming language I work with all the time: Python. What I like about Python is that one of its super-strengths is its usefulness in data science and machine learning, while it is still a general-purpose language that be used for virtually anything, including Web/App Development (Check out Django or Flask for Web and Kivy for App), general software development, etc.  

I put all the resources I used to review Python, and learn more advanced concepts.

Course | Python for Data Science  

While this course is intended to focus on "Data Science," it still provides a comprehensive review of many Python concepts. Please note that these notebooks are not created by me. 

* All the notebooks with the unique sequence of letters **"PY0101EN"** are from this course.
