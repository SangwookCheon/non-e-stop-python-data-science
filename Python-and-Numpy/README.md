# Study of Python and Numpy
## Introduction
I chose python as the foundational language for machine learning, so I created this folder to review my knowledge and add more skills in Python along the way. I do have experience working with Python, but there are many advanced concepts and operations that I have not looked into yet.

Numpy goes hand-in-hand with python for machine learning. Many of the high-level machine learning libraries are based on Numpy, and knowing Numpy will be very beneficial for the process of learning machine learning algorithms and advanced mathematical operations.

## Folders
I added two subfolders for this: Python Basics and Python Advanced. Any materials that count as review for me will go to the Python Basics folder. Anything else will be put into Python Advanced. Python basics will include materials up to Classes and IO. Content related to Numpy will go into the Numpy folder.
