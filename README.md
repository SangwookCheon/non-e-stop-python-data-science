# Python Data Science References 
Creator: Sangwook Cheon 

In this repository, I organized all the learning materials that I worked with related to Data Science, and also documented notes that I took along the way. This serves to be a refenrence guide for me when I work on Data Science projects, and hopefully will be useful to anyone who takes a look at this. 

To clarify, this is a repository to document my progressive learning of data science, so separate repositories will be created for any actual data science projects. I will add links to each one of them below.  

Some of the notebooks are not entirely created by me, as course providers prepared notebooks for learning. For these, I followed instructions on the notebook, and then when completed, I downloaded them. But there are many that I created by myself as a reference. In each notebook, I wrote down where the notebook was from, or wrote my name if I created the notebook.

## Sections:  
Note: All the notebooks are based on Python 3.0. Please click on 
* [Data Processing and Analysis](https://github.com/SangwookCheon/python-datascience/tree/master/Data%20Processing%20and%20Analysis) - Processing and analyzing data to prepare for machine learning models. Uses libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to work with data.
* [Data Science Methodology](https://github.com/SangwookCheon/python-datascience/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Methodology) - General framework for data science projects developed by IBM. Follow this framework to work on projects effectively.
* [Data Visualization](https://github.com/SangwookCheon/python-datascience/tree/master/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python) - Visualizing data to gain initial insights.
* [Databases and SQL](https://github.com/SangwookCheon/python-datascience/tree/master/Databases%20and%20SQL) - Managing large datasets, or Big Data, for machine learning.
* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/SangwookCheon/python-datascience/tree/master/Machine%20Learning) - Various supervised and unsupervised machine learning models using libraries like Keras, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, etc.
* [Python Review](https://github.com/SangwookCheon/python-datascience/tree/master/Python%20Review) - Review of basic Python concepts, and focus more specifically on skills needed for Data Science.
